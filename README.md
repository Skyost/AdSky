## Introduction
AdSky is a way for you, as a Minecraft server owner, to monetize your server. Currently, there are two kinds of ads : [Title ads](https://github.com/Skyost/AdSky/blob/server/assets/img/previews/preview-0.png) and [Chat ads](https://github.com/Skyost/AdSky/blob/server/assets/img/previews/preview-1.png). Advertisers choose the type of ad they want to broadcast on your server, customize it (Title / subtitle, duration, display per day, ...), pay it according to the price you set up and voil√† !

There are two parts : *Server* and *Plugin*.

### Server part
The server part is a PHP + MySQL application that you install on your own web server, it is where advertisers will register and broadcast their ads. To see how to install it and the requirements, please check the [*Installation*](https://github.com/Skyost/AdSky/tree/server#installation) section of the server branch's README.

### Plugin part
The plugin part is a simple Bukkit / Sponge plugin that is going to link up with the server part. To see how to install it and the requirements, please check the [*Installation*](#installation) section.

## Features
AdSky is built to be lightweight, but it still has a lot of features :

 - Free and open-source.
 - Can be run on *almost* any server that as PHP + MySQL installed.
 - Everything is configurable.
 - Lightweight.
 - Android application. <sub>Coming soon !</sub>

## Installation

To install the server part, please check the [*Installation*](https://github.com/Skyost/AdSky#installation) section of the server branch's README.

### CraftBukkit / Spigot

To install the Bukkit plugin, you have to download [the JAR](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/adsky/files) and put it inside the `plugins` folder located in your server directory.

You need either CraftBukkit or Spigot. Any version above _1.8_ should work.

### Sponge

To install the Sponge plugin, you have to download [the JAR](https://ore.spongepowered.org/Skyost/AdSky/versions/recommended/download) and put it inside the `mods` folder located in your server directory.

Any Sponge version above _7.0.0_ (included) should work.

## Configuration
The configuration file is `plugins/AdSky/config.yml` for CraftBukkit and `config/adsky-sponge.conf` for Sponge. Open it and configure it as you want :

|          | `distribution-function` | Here's how it works. The `h` will be replaced by the preferred hour, the `n` by the number of ads of the day and `x` by an hour. The function will be evaluated with these parameters with a rounding mode of [UP](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html) at each hour; first `h`, then `h-1`, then `h+1`, ... The process will be repeated while all ads are not scheduled.<br>Another good distribution function could be `((-1/n) * (x-h)^2) + (log(n)/log(10))`. |

**Important :** If you cannot see the ads, it means you have the permission `adsky.bypass` (which is granted to ops by default). If you want to see the ads, please turn off the permission for yourself.

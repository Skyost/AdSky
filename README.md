## Introduction
AdSky is a way for you, as a Minecraft server owner, to monetize your server. Currently, there are two kinds of ads : [Title ads](https://github.com/Skyost/AdSky/blob/server/assets/img/previews/preview-0.png) and [Chat ads](https://github.com/Skyost/AdSky/blob/server/assets/img/previews/preview-1.png). Advertisers choose the type of ad they want to broadcast on your server, customize it (Title / subtitle, duration, display per day, ...), pay it according to the price you set up and voil√† !

There are two parts : *Server* and *Plugin*.

### Server part
The server part is a PHP + MySQL application that you install on your own web server, it is where advertisers will register and broadcast their ads. To see how to install it and the requirements, please check the [*Installation*](https://github.com/Skyost/AdSky/tree/server#installation) section of the server branch's README.

### Plugin part
The plugin part is a simple Bukkit / Sponge plugin that is going to link up with the server part. To see how to install it and the requirements, please check the [*Installation*](#installation) section.

## Features
AdSky is built to be lightweight, but it still has a lot of features :

 - Free and open-source.
 - Can be run on *almost* any server that as PHP + MySQL installed.
 - Everything is configurable.
 - Lightweight.
 - Android application. <sub>Coming soon !</sub>

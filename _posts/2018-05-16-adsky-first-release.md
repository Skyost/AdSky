title: "AdSky : First release !"
---

Hey everyone,

It's been some months since I started developing AdSky.
As you can see, the [first commit](https://github.com/Skyost/AdSky/commit/ecf16175735db46f12da74ad907a39fc6f5fd086) has been pushed to Github on 25th March 2018
but I started the writing even before.

Well, yes, first what is AdSky ? Basically, it's a way for you, as a server owner to monetize your Minecraft server. There are two parts : plugin part and server part.

So, the server part is a little PHP / MySQL server where publishers will pay to display ads on your server.

The plugin part consists of a little Bukkit / Sponge that you install on your Minecraft server.
This plugin is going to link up with the server, and will display all registered ads.

If you want a video tutorial on how to install it with a small demo, then here is it :
